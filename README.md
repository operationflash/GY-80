The Arduino files uses different librarys from different people (non by me)
The Adafruit librarys are all from Adafruit and can be found on the GitHub from Adafruit
I'm not sure who made the L3G4200D library because that information was not given on the site
where I found it, but I think it was made by pololu. Because I found the same library on his
GitHub. But correct my if I'm wrong.
